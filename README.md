**Advanced Equipment** is a mod for Arma 3, that is still under development. I wanted to create a mod, that allows you to really use a lot of the vanilla equipment like laptops and lamps.

This project is entirely **open-source** and all contributions are welcome. Feel free to maintain your own custom version, as long as the changes you make are open to the public in accordance with the ([APL-SA](https://www.bistudio.com/community/licenses/arma-public-license-share-alike)).

## Features

- Power Management (Power Consumption, Batteries, Sun Collectors, Generators)
- Interaction (Turn On/Off/Standby/Adjust/Use things like Laptops and Lamps)
- armaOS (Unique Terminal-like interface for computers)
- Network Management (only basics implemented yet)
- Logistics (Fold and unfold objects, move them around, put them into vehicles)
- 3DEN Modules (Easy Mission Making)
